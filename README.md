Since the covid_resnet.keras model in the ai directory is a large file, you need to use lfs to fetch it by using the command
"git lfs pull"

Make sure that you have downloaded Git LFS and use the command "git lfs install" in your repository first

or you can download the model from this link:

Here are the colab links for training the model:
